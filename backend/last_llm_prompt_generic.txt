4. UNUSED INDEXES: []

YOUR GOAL: 
Explain the score and prioritize the issues. 
If a query has high 'DB Load %' (even if low latency), it is a CRITICAL optimization target. 
Demand specific fixes (like "Add index for join") in your explanation.

STRICT RULES FOR 'type' AND 'action_payload':
1. type="QUERY": Use ONLY for specific slow/heavy queries from the WORKLOAD SUMMARY.
   - action_payload MUST be the 'queryid' (e.g., "123456789"). DO NOT put SQL here.
2. type="SCHEMA": Use for Bloat, Vacuum, or Missing Index issues.
   - action_payload MUST be the generic SQL command to fix it (e.g., "VACUUM FULL public.users;", "CREATE INDEX ON...").
3. type="CONFIG": Use for Postgres settings (work_mem, etc).
   - action_payload MUST be the SQL command to change it (e.g., "ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '64MB';").
}
